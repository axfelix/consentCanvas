ConsentCanvas

ABOUT

	ConsentCanvas uses unsupervised natural language processing (NLP)
	techniques to make end-user license agreements (EULAs) more readable.
	A plaintext EULA is the input, and the output is an HTML5 document.

REQUIREMENTS

	ConsentCanvas requires:

		Python 2.6.5+
		NLTK 2.0b9
		a modified version of the markup library
			(originally from http://markup.sourceforge.net)
			(this is included in markup.py)	


USE

	To use ConsentCanvas, type:

		python ConsentCanvas.py <eula>

	where <eula> is a plaintext end user license agreement. The HTML5
	document will be printed to standard output, so you may want to
	use the following command on a Unix system:

		python ConsentCanvas.py <eula> > output.html

	Then, copy textured-agreement-clean-1.css to the same folder as
	your output file (output.html in this case), and open your output
	file with your favourite browser.


NOTES ON COMPLETENESS

	ConsentCanvas is a work-in-progress. Although this is a working
	implementation, many improvements are necessary before it can
	reliably improve readability. As well, no official verification
	of said improvements have yet been conducted.
